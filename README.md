## Introduction
Restmold (pronounced /restÀê/ /mold:/) is a Laravel package for modeling 3rd party HTTP services and as an HTTP client. Using this package will allow you to model your external HTTP services. 
The magic behind Restmold is that you don't need to repeatedly re-code your API class services. 

### Inspiration
The inspiration for this project started when the company I worked for migrated our giant monolith into a bunch of small microservices.
Time passed, and we found ourselves writing API services repeatedly as the number of services grew. So, inspired by the flow of Laravel's models, Restmold has born out.
