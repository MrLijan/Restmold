## Introduction
Restmold (pronounced /restÀê/ /mold:/) is a Laravel package for modeling 3rd party HTTP services and as an HTTP client. Using this package will allow you to model your external HTTP services. 
The magic behind Restmold is that you don't need to repeatedly re-code your API class services.
